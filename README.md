### About
This is the `repository` for my personal portfolio website.
#### What is a portfolio website ? 
 It is an online representation of work you have created, as well as your skills and experiences. It could be a website, blog, or even a video channel. It is generally an online mean of showcasing your profile to everyone, it can be of any theme, it can be minimalistic, professional, funky, animative, etc.

 ### Inspiration ðŸ¤”
After teaching myself web development basics I always wanted to make a personal website, but I didn't. I rather focused on learning more and make some projects. After months I finally made one to showcase my info, projects, skills and other work. If you are someone like me or from any domain, I would suggest you to make one for yourself, it is awesome to have a personal website.
